Padmasree Warrior, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT-D) alumna and founder & CEO of Fable – a virtual book club app – on Saturday said leaders of the future needed to learn how to lead in the post-pandemic world where there are “no boundaries between work, home, and society”. She was speaking at the 52nd convocation of IIT-D.

Addressing graduating students virtually from Chicago, Warrior, who’s also a board member at Microsoft and Spotify, said, “In my view, leaders of the future must know how to lead when there are no boundaries between work, home, and society. We all experienced this blurring of boundaries in 2020. When I started my career – work, home, and society had a clear separation. This is not the case anymore. We work from home, and our work is influenced by (and, in turn, influences) society, politics, culture. As leaders we cannot turn a blind eye or close our ears to everything that is happening around us.”","Volunteer work should be listed on your resume using the same format as your work experience section. In other words, you should include the organization you volunteered for, its location, the time frame, followed by a bulleted list explaining what you accomplished while volunteering there."

I am a freshman At my college but I am one of the most risk-taking ones. I believe that risk-taking is important in entrepreneurship as one who takes risks is likely to grow more. Also, at my age risk-taking is not doing any damage as I do not have anything to lose. I may have little professional experience but I am looking forward to gaining some in the CAP programme. ","Being a representative of my college, It would be a great opportunity for me to promote entrepreneurial activities in my college. I would start Social media marketing through LinkedIn and Instagram as most of the students on the campus are on Instagram and most of the faculties are on LinkedIn. This would also promote the use of LinkedIn as a professional social media platform and also at the same time promote entrepreneurship. I would also connect to my college seniors who are currently building brands as a seminar would be very effective. Other than that, I would organise Quizzes and competitions related to entrepreneurship on a regular basis to promote entrepreneurship.","I have recently been selected as a campus Ambassador to the Entrepreneurship cell, at IIT Madras but as it was done just 3 days ago, I do not have any experience as a CA.

I have been the discipline, attendence leader along with the class representative for almost 7 years.Also, was the group leader in science model making competition. Currently, I am a student placement coordinator in my college along with a member in student council and rocketry team.So, I am well-experienced to handle the given role."

I'm getting ready to start developing a product-based startup, and I have a different perspective on how ideas become realities. The logo I recently designed for my college's AET club's Industry 4.0 project, Project SMVDU SDP, will soon be recognised by IIT Delhi. I worked on it and came in second place at a Microsoft Azure hackathon showcasing a website that may assist introverts to collectively solve their doubts and groom their skills.","If chosen as the Campus ambassador, I would serve as a delegate for my college with immense pride and responsibility, carrying their prestige on my shoulders, and bolstering their status on a much more global scale. Additionally, I would do my bit to promote linkages between colleges and other reputable institutions throughout the nation. Thereby, establishing a cooperative strategy for combining the assets available to create a strong network of young and competent workers. This would be achieved by creating a strong mesh-like system that would encourage institutional symbiosis and, in turn, foster a sense of community and cooperation. Nurturing a strong sense of startup culture and collaborative entrepreneurship that would enable the brightest brains in the nation to collaborate on creating the future despite being geographically divided.

National Institute of Technology Agartala,amit896689@gmail.com,8318125737,AMIT KUMAR SINGH,"A campus ambassador is a representative of a company or organization on a college or university campus. They are responsible for promoting the company or organization and its products or services to students on campus. There are several qualities that make a good candidate for a campus ambassador program.

First and foremost, a good campus ambassador should be passionate about the company or organization they are representing. They should be enthusiastic about the products or services that the company offers and be able to effectively communicate this enthusiasm to others.

Secondly, a good campus ambassador should be a good communicator. They should be able to effectively communicate the company's message to students on campus and be able to answer any questions that students may have. They should also be able to work well with others, as they will be interacting with other members of the campus ambassador program as well as other students on campus.

Third, a good campus ambassador should be organized and able to manage their time effectively. They will need to be able to coordinate events and promotions on campus, so being able to manage their time and schedule is essential.

Finally, a good campus ambassador should be a good networker. They should be able to connect with other students on campus and build relationships with them. This will help them to effectively promote the company or organization and its products or services.

Overall, the qualities of a good campus ambassador include passion, good communication skills, organization, and networking ability. These qualities will help them to effectively represent the company or organization on campus and promote its products or services to students. And I think, I am having all these qualities to be a good campus ambassador.","As a campus ambassador for EDC IITD, I would take the responsibility and leadership to spread the word about the organization by using my communication and networking skills. I would work to build relationships with other students on campus and effectively promote EDC IITD and its programs to them. I would also organize events and promotions on campus to help raise awareness about EDC IITD and its initiatives.

One of the ways I would do this is by utilizing social media to share information about EDC IITD and its programs. I would create engaging posts and graphics to help capture the attention of other students on campus and encourage them to learn more about EDC IITD. I would also use my social media networks to connect with other students on campus who may be interested in EDC IITD and its programs.

In addition to utilizing social media, I would also work to organize events and promotions on campus. For example, I might plan a booth at a campus fair where I can interact with other students and share information about EDC IITD. I would also work to coordinate events and workshops that would help students learn more about EDC IITD and its programs.

I believe that my experience in student government, where I served as a class representative, has prepared me well for this role. In this position, I was responsible for representing the interests of my classmates and working to build relationships with them. I believe that this experience has given me the communication and networking skills that are essential for success as a campus ambassador for EDC IITD.","One of my experiences that aligns with the purpose of a campus ambassador program is my work as a student government representative. In this role, I was responsible for representing the interests of my classmates and working to build relationships with them. This experience helped me to develop strong communication and networking skills, which are essential for success as a campus ambassador.

Another experience that aligns with the purpose of a campus ambassador program is my work as a volunteer for a local non-profit organization. In this role, I was responsible for promoting the organization and its programs to the community. This experience helped me to learn how to effectively communicate the organization's message and to build relationships with others in order to promote its programs.

Overall, my experiences in student government and as a volunteer have given me the skills and knowledge that are necessary for success as a campus ambassador. I am confident that I would be able to effectively represent a company or organization on campus and promote its products or services to students."

Apart from technology, I am very enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and want to start my own startup.
Right now, I am learning web development and know basic Python and Django, and I have just started to learn graphic design using Canva.
Apart from them, I think the thing that makes me different from others is that I take initiatives.
You can definitely find people with better coding and communication skills than me, but I guarantee you that you can't find a more enthusiastic person who wants to learn than me."," I am a part of EDC and some societies in my college, I first gather people who are already interested in entrepreneurship and people who have decent amount of followers , and with the help of them, I will convey messages via different WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc. about the events organised by EDC IIT Delhi. Also, I believe that even in the era of digital advertisements, traditional ways of advertising are just as powerful as digital advertising, so I will paste some posters and distribute some pamphlets to advertise the events. I will also use email marketing, all the notifications regarding Edc IIT Delhi events will be send via email.Also, my major motive is to spread awareness about EDC IIT Delhi and motivate students at my college to pursue entrepreneurship, and to do that, I will post some content on social media and try to organise workshops and seminars in my college.","As I am in my first year, I don't have any prior experience as a Campus Ambassador of any program, but in class 12th I have participated in one of the interschool competitions, which I didn't win, but I got to meet a lot of new people, and among those people I met a head boy of DPS RK Puram who is a graphic designer, so I asked him some advice as I also want to learn, and after talking to him, I got to know that in DPS RK Puram there was an coding event which was organised only for the girls, but our school had to register for the event.
So, I asked my computer science teacher, and she told me that for this, she had to get permission from the principal, which I don't know the reason for, but anyhow, we didn't get the permission to participate. But after that, I just thought, why not start a coding club in my school that participated in competitions like these? As I am from a convent girls school, I discussed this idea with my computer science teacher, who's very supportive, and she instantly agreed. So, me and three more friends started this technology club in our school, and
I think for me, this is the lifelong experience where I learned from my failures, learned teamwork, and learned how to convince the right people to join.
Learn some key things about leadership and much more."

To be a successful campus ambassador, you may need to have strong communication and networking skills, as well as a good understanding of the college community and the target audience for the brand, product, or service you are promoting. You should also be organized, proactive, and able to work independently and as part of a team.

One approach i will  use social media to reach a wide audience and share information about eDC IITD and its activities. This could include creating posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as sharing relevant articles, events, and resources.

Another strategy i will  collaborate with other student organizations or groups on campus and co-sponsor events or activities related to eDC IITD. This could help to raise awareness and engage a diverse audience.

Additionally, i could leverage my personal network and connections on campus to promote eDC IITD and encourage others to get involved.
